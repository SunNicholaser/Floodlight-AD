Project Tasks

1. Write the code 
2. Analyze the collected data in the background 
3. Add  a set of base rules
4. We will be using the basic learning switch module that we already have
5. Add more logic for adding smart rules		
6. We tried to use IStaticFlowEntryPusherService to add and delete flow rules as well as to grab statistics from the switch. 
	But the output we got did not have the desired fields in it. So we decided to go with a custom StatCollector which runs in
	the background.

Assumptions
1. Use the learning switch module that came in with the floodlight
