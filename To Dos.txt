Project Tasks
1. Come up with the Central Logic
	- Deciding the base rules
	- Monitoring the log file
	- Detect Anomaly 
	- Add new rules if needed 
	- Analyze the collected data in the background 




Workflow

1. Start the controller with the modified learning switch and anomaly detector modules
2. Packet comes in any port the modified learning switch installs rules for every source destination ip pair with infinite hard timeout and lowest priority
3. Detection unit gets the flows using the rest api. 
4. For every different flow the detection unit with the help of the stat collector, extracts five tuple and two counts and the cookie. 
5. For each flow gets the total flow count and contribution 
6. If for any flow the contribution is above a threshold, a cluster is made and the rest is collapsed to a more general cluster when possible. 
7. For the suspicious cluster will have all the extracted information.
